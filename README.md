# Pointer Server
Use this instead of laser pointers when using a big screen tv as your demo/work screen

# Usage
Select "Mouse Mode" to use your mouse pointer to move around the pointer on the target screen.  If there are 2 or more monitors, more than 1 monitor destination will be displayed.  Click on the monitor icon which represents the position of the monitor you want to use the pointer against.
